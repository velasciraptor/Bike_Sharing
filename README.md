# Bike_Sharing
## Overview:
Recently, a friend and I went sight-seeing in New York. The beauty of the experience was magnified by our bike trip through Central Park where we had an idea. Riding through the fresh air together was fun like childhood, efficient like adulthood, and beautiful as the city we were in. Why not bring the experience to Des Moines in the form of our own start-up? So we took a dive into the data of NYC's CitiBike to explore the possibility.

## Results
The first question I asked myself is how long do consumers actually use the bikes? If the bikes are in use for a very long time, it would be expensive to buy the amount of bikes needed. However, as we can see below, bike trips last less than an hour!

So a bike is accessible for the next cutomer fairly quickly. Let us look further into detail about who rides the bike for what amount of time was next.

Why do the gender lines differ?

Gender is not the only way to categorise clients, though. We have subscribers and customers.

We can see that subcribers make up more that 3/4ths of the bike rentals, so the next question is, when during the week are the bikes being rented?

Now let us look at gender, but at the same time take the analysis further by adding the time of each day as well.

Each of the genders has a similar pattern. When we take a step back, we can see the general idea of when the bikes are rented for all clients regardless of category.

## Summary
So we know that subscribers make up more activity than customers and males make up more than females and unknowns, but of the subcribers and customers, what percentage of these are male, female, and unknown?
